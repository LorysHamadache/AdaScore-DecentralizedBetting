# Decentralized Betting

This project, Decentralized Betting, allow people to bet peer to peer without the crushing odds of a bookmaker. Simply create a bet that suits you risk appetite and what you belive is fair odds and let someone accept the bet. The result is provided by a third party via an Oracle.

## Incentives

** For the bet creator **

1. Create a bet that matches your need, risk profile and wanted gains
2. It is important to issue a fair bet for someone to be able to accept it. What "fair" is is totally up to you
3. Create multiple bet across matches to maximize gains without having a bookmaker making sure that your expected gains is under zero.
4. No censorship, if you win consistently, no centralized party will restrict your potential for betting

** For the bet acceptor **

1. Only bet on matches that fits your wanted odds.
2. If you cannot find a bet that suits you, create a bet yourself
3. Fees are paid by the match creator

** For the oracle **

1. Providing accurate data is totally in the best interest of the oracle as no one will use the platform otherwise
